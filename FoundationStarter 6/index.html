<h1>Big Ten Schools Debt Edtion</h1> 
<p style ="font-family:verdana"> In the couple of states that were selected in the chart, Maryland, Penn, Ohio, and Illinois all had massive changes throughout the past 3 years. Most of the charts from those states went from low to increasingly going high or going high to going low to sky rocketing high up later on. It seems like Navient had an isssue with student loan which causes them many claims of cases which people tries to involve a lawsuit.</p>

<p style ="font-family:verdana"> For Maryland, it around 1,200 in Jan 2021, went around 100 in Oct 2021, amd sky rocketing even more in Oct 2022 where it reached around 2,000. With Penn, Ohio, and Illinois some of it started higher than others but at the end it skyrocketing by a lot around the start of 2023 or in Oct 2022. Most of the loans were federal especially because it is a Big Ten School and where as it is popular and want more students and money situation, it defentiley seems a lot more than the non-federal schools. Most of the complainst were dealing with Navient from they treated the students of not getting what they wanted. There are more reviews everywhere from how people are still fighting against Navient or how Navient slowed their life dow.</p>
